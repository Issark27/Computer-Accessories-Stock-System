The system developed using object-oriented principles allows customers of a computer accessories shop to purchase stock from a company and pay for all items in their basket which directly changes the quantity of the 
item in the stock .txt file. The system admins have different functionality such that they can add items to the stock given a specific set of information. The system was able to display this information through a 
graphical user interface that was developed using Java Swing. This allowed for a simple user experience to carry out their necessary tasks. The cas.jar file is the most simple way to execute the system however 
ensure that the required text files (UserAccounts.txt and Stock.txt) are placed in their correct location or else the system will not be able to interpret the information properly.
